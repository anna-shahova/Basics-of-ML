# Basics-of-ML

This repository provides examples of code for Machine Learning, specifically supervised learning. Such methods are considered as Classification and Linear Regression. Metrics that are used to analyze learning outcomes are also considered separately.

# Classification

3 datasets have been generated for classification. A model was made based on the KNN method. For each dataset, graphs of classification accuracy for different k and confusion matrices are plotted. To analyze the learning model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.

# Linear Regression

The dataset attached in the files was selected for training. Based on the correlation analysis, 3 variables were selected that most strongly affect the target variable (Price). The accuracy of the model was measured on the training and test data set and the metric r2_score for each variable, which is known as the coefficient of determination.

# Metrics

A simple example illustrates the internal construction of metrics as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, macro avg and weigthed avg.
